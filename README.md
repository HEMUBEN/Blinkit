# BLINKIT DASHBOARD
# 1) BLINKIT PROJECT
* Worked on analyzing and optimizing Blinkit’s instant grocery delivery operations using data-driven insights. The project focused on understanding customer behavior, demand forecasting, and delivery performance to    improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.
* Blinkit (formerly Grofers) is an instant grocery delivery platform acquired by Zomato. It operates on a 10–20 minute quick commerce model, delivering groceries, household items, and essentials through a network of   dark stores (small warehouses located in neighborhoods).
# 2) Technologies
1. Data Collection & Storage
SQL Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server) → for transactional order & inventory data.
NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra) → for real-time order updates and customer interactions.
Cloud Data Warehouses
Google BigQuery
Amazon Redshift
Snowflake
→ Used to store and process large-scale sales, delivery, and customer data.
2. Data Processing & Pipeline
ETL Tools: Apache Airflow, Talend, Informatica → for scheduling and automating data pipelines.
Big Data Frameworks: Apache Spark, Hadoop → for large-scale analytics.
Streaming Tools: Kafka, Flink → for real-time updates (e.g., order status, live delivery tracking).
3. Dashboard & Visualization
Power BI – interactive dashboards for business teams.
Tableau – for advanced visualization & executive reporting.
Looker (Google Cloud) – often used with BigQuery for embedded analytics.
Custom Dashboards – built using React.js, D3.js, Plotly, Grafana for operations (like live delivery tracking).
5. Analytics & Machine Learning Integration
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow) → demand forecasting, delivery time prediction, customer segmentation.
R → statistical modeling and advanced analytics.
6. Monitoring & Real-time Ops Dashboard
Grafana + Prometheus → for monitoring server performance, delivery tracking, and real-time KPIs.
Elastic Stack (ELK: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) → for log analytics & operational dashboards.

7. Blinkit-style dashboard project for your portfolio, the closest tech stack would be:
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
ETL: Python + Pandas (or Airflow if you want real feel)
Visualization: Power BI / Tableau
Advanced: Add a Kafka + Grafana layer for real-time dashboards.
# 3) Data Sorces Blinkit Might Connect to
Over the last 3 years, our data analytics team has grown from one central team of 4 to over 100 members. Our analysts are spread across our data team, business functions and data science teams. So needless to say, as both data and the team grew, our ways of working had to change to meet the demand of easy, collaborative data access without the bottlenecks of a central control room.
